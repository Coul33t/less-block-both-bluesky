# Less/Block/Both Bluesky
As the title says, it adds three buttons under each Bluesky posts in your feed:
* See Less Often
* Block
* Both

This was created because I'm f*cking fed up with USA's politics being thrown at me all the time over there. Currently doesn't work for when you click on a specific post, might do it later. I was going for a " quick mute " button at first, but there's no " mute this person " shortcut in the burger menu, so I'll resort to directly block people from now on.
