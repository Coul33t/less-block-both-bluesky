# Less/Block/Both Bluesky
As the title says, it adds three buttons under each Bluesky posts in your feed:
* See Less Often
* Block
* Both

Based on [this](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/twitterxlinkedinbluesky-o/ibnghddpkdpbgcfcaajdhpnkfgbdadpp?hl=en), but I removed the other parts, because I already have another one for Twitter, and if you go on LinkedIn, well you honestly deserve the bullshit your being fed over there.

### Very important history about this
This was created because I'm f*cking fed up with USA's politics being thrown at me all the time over there. I was going for a " quick mute " button at first, but there's no " mute this person " shortcut in the burger menu, so I'll resort to directly block people from now on.

## Todo
Currently doesn't work for when you click on a specific post, might do it later.
